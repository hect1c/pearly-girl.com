For example the payment method &quot;on account&quot;. <br />
<br />
Adding below code can be done for each payment method located in catalog/includes/modules/payment. Just look for the line starting with &quot;$this-&gt;enabled = etc etc... and add this right below it.<br />
<br />
    function update_status() {<br />
      global $order;<br />
      global $customer_id;<br />
<br />
//enable or disable the payment module based on user account type<br />
      if ( $this-&gt;enabled == true ) {<br />
        $check_flag = false;<br />
<br />
        $check_query = tep_db_query(&quot;select customers_usertype from &quot; . TABLE_CUSTOMERS . &quot; where customers_id = '&quot; . $customer_id .&quot;'&quot;);<br />
<br />
        while ($check = tep_db_fetch_array($check_query)) {<br />
          if ($check['customers_usertype']== b) {<br />
            $check_flag = true;<br />
            break;<br />
          }<br />
        }<br />
<br />
        if ($check==b) $check_flag=true;<br />
        if ($check_flag == false) {<br />
          $this-&gt;enabled = false;<br />
        }<br />
      }<br />
<br />
The result is that this particular payment method will no longer show up for users with a Private account, but only for users with a Business account. <br />
<br />
If you would like to have it the other way around, just change  this line:<br />
  if ($check['customers_usertype']== b) { <br />
to this:<br />
  if ($check['customers_usertype']== h) {<br />
<br />
Hope this is helpful to others looking for such a solution.
